### 1. INTRODUCTION. <a name="id1"></a>

In the business environment that we know and that surrounds us, we have detected that the software used by many of them is very outdated and they are not agile at all. In this context, the need arises to develop a technological solution to optimize and streamline the processes related to inventory management, route planning and human resources management in the logistics field.

The main objective of the logistics management project is to develop a functional web platform that will provide companies with a comprehensive tool for the efficient management of their logistics. This platform will provide key functionalities, such as inventory management, the assignment of optimized routes for product delivery, and the administration of users with different roles and permissions. At all times, priority will be given to optimized functionality and usability, designed to be simple and easy to use for any user without much knowledge.

The platform will be designed to be highly scalable and customizable, which will allow to adapt it to the specific needs of each company and sector, so we are going to develop it in a relatively generic way allowing to adapt it to any field. In addition, technologies such as Vue.js for the frontend and Django for the backend will be integrated, along with Docker for container/database management, ensuring optimal performance and easy implementation in different working environments.

In summary, the logistics management project aims to provide companies with a complete and adaptable technological solution to optimize their logistics operations. With a focus on efficiency, scalability and customization, this platform will become an indispensable tool to improve the competitiveness and performance of companies in today's market.

### 2. ORIGIN, CONTEXTUALIZATION AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT. <a name="id2"></a>

The logistics management project arises as a response to a series of needs and challenges identified in the business environment, which we have known from family and friends who have experienced problems with outdated and poorly optimized software, in addition to a very poor usability.

#### Origin of the Idea:

The idea of developing a logistics management platform arises from the observation of the difficulties and limitations faced by many companies in the administration of their logistics processes. As we mentioned in the introduction, we know of several close cases of store/warehouse managers who suffer day to day with having to deal with very old software. This is where the idea of optimizing and improving all this software was born, as well as doing it with cutting-edge technologies to improve the user experience.

#### Needs Detected:

- Inventory Management:
  Many companies face difficulties in keeping accurate control of their inventory, which can lead to financial losses and delays in product delivery. Managing the stock of a large company and being able to see where that stock is distributed among the different stores and warehouses in an efficient and simple way is one of the main needs we have detected regarding this point.
- Route Planning:
  Manual planning of delivery routes can be inefficient and error-prone, resulting in extended delivery times and higher operating costs. In addition, we know of cases where there is not even a software prepared for the management of these routes and they continue to be done manually or on paper. With this we want to streamline the process both for the administrators who create the routes and for the delivery drivers to be able to consult directly in an application the places they have to deliver to.
- Team Coordination:
  Coordinating work teams, especially in distributed logistics environments, can be a challenge, with communication and task tracking issues. In this particular need we have detected the need to make the same application that can distinguish the type of user that is accessing it. In this way we avoid having to use several applications or sacrifice the usability of some users to give it to others.

#### Problems to be addressed:

The project seeks to address these issues by providing a comprehensive platform that allows companies to efficiently manage their logistics operations. By centralizing inventory management, route planning and team coordination on a single platform, it is expected to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction.

#### Project Justification:

The justification for carrying out this project lies in the need for companies to have advanced technological tools that allow them to compete effectively in an increasingly demanding and competitive market. By providing a comprehensive and adaptable solution to the specific needs of each company, the logistics management project seeks to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of companies in the logistics field.

In summary, the logistics management project arises as a response to the needs and challenges identified in the business environment, with the objective of providing a comprehensive technological solution that allows companies to optimize their logistics operations and improve their competitiveness in today's market.

### 3. GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT. <a name="id3"></a>

The main purpose of this project is to develop and implement a complete and robust web platform that optimizes business logistics management. This platform aims to offer an adaptable solution capable of effectively addressing the challenges of the logistics sector. In essence, we seek to optimize and automate key logistics processes, centralize relevant information in a single application, improve the customer and business experience always seeking to reduce the time spent using the software, ensure adaptability and scalability so that the application fits in all logistics companies that would like to use the application, integrate advanced technologies and ensure continuous improvement and constant updating of the platform among other objectives related to increasing productivity for the company. In short, we aspire to create an innovative tool that not only improves operational efficiency and reduces costs, but also boosts business competitiveness and raises customer satisfaction standards in the logistics field.

### 4. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT (SCOPE). <a name="id4"></a>

The project will be developed as a logistics management web application covering multiple aspects of business operations, from inventory management to delivery route planning and coordination of work teams with role differentiation. Each aspect of the project is detailed in greater depth below:

Architecture and Structure:

The application will be divided into three main components: frontend, backend and database.
For the frontend, Vue.js will be used with the Composition API, which will allow a modular and reusable structure for the user interface.

For the backend, Django will be used as the main framework, using Django Rest Framework for the creation of a RESTful API to handle requests and responses between the frontend and the database.

The database will be hosted in a Docker container and PostgreSQL will be used as the relational database management system, ensuring security and data integrity.

It is a relatively simple architecture as we do not stop communicating things through an API, so no complex architecture is needed.

2. General Operation:

Users will be able to access the application through an authentication system that will use JWT tokens (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.

Once authenticated, users will have access to different functionalities according to their role, such as inventory management, route planning and user administration.

Inventory management will allow users to add, edit and delete products, as well as track stock and generate inventory reports.

Route planning will allow users to create optimized routes for product delivery, taking into account factors such as distance, delivery time and resource availability. If you are a user with a delivery role, you will be able to see which route has been assigned to you and you will be able to finalize it in order to appear as available again.

3. Data Validation and Security:

A validation layer will be implemented on both the frontend and backend to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data entered by users.

On the frontend, form validation methods provided by Vue.js will be used to ensure that the data entered by users meets the specified criteria.

On the backend, data validation mechanisms will be implemented using Django's form validation capabilities, as well as custom validations as needed.

To ensure the security of the application, standard security measures will be implemented, such as protection against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, as well as secure storage of passwords using hashing algorithms.

4. Integration of Development Tools:

Development tools such as Git will be used for code version control, allowing detailed tracking of changes and efficient collaboration between team members.
An agile development flow will be implemented, using methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban through github itself, to guarantee an iterative and continuous delivery of features and improvements. As for the development technologies, they will be those previously mentioned.

In summary, the logistics management project will be developed as a complete and robust web application that will use modern technologies and development practices to provide an efficient and secure solution for managing enterprise logistics operations. With a focus on modularity, scalability and security, the application will provide an intuitive and functional user experience, improving operational efficiency and business competitiveness in today's marketplace.
